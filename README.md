Flame Guard : Advanced Fire Detection System Via Machine Learning And Image Processing 
About
A comprehensive approach to fire detection by utilizing advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. The proposed method integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm, and diverse machine learning techniques to create a highly efficient and accurate fire detection system. Through CNN's ability to extract complex features from images, the model can recognize intricate fire-related patterns.
Features
The camera-based fire monitoring system can monitor the specified area in real time through video processing. When a fire is detected based on the video, it will send a captured alarm image to the administrator. The administrator makes a final confirmation based on the submitted alarm image. For example, when an accident occurs on a highway and causes a fire, based on the image transmitted by the detection algorithm, one can immediately rescue the victims, saving precious time and minimizing damage. 

Requirements
Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
Additional Dependencies: Includes scikit-learn, TensorFlow (versions 2.4.1), TensorFlow GPU, OpenCV, and Mediapipe for deep learning tasks.

Detection Accuracy: 96.7% Note: These metrics can be customized based on your actual performance evaluations.

Results and Impact
 We ran comparison tests with the most recent methods to evaluate
the efficacy of our suggested approach. We devised multiple
statistical standards for assessment. To begin with, the software must
correctly identify and categorize fire incidents. Second, we
compared the detection accuracy of our technique with other
algorithms and looked at the accuracy of flame area identification in
the fire classification image. We also contrasted our method's rates
for false positives and false negatives with those of other algorithms.
After that, we evaluated how quickly our approach executed in
comparison to cutting-edge technologies.
